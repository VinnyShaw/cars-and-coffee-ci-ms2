## Bugs and fixes

<!-- On the initial live upload of the website to GitHub Pages, it was discovered that the background-images were not displaying properly on mobile devices. In particular ios devices. On further research, it was discovered that this is a known bug with devices running ios13 and above.

After troubleshooting any CSS rules relating to the background-images, it was discovered that the the was caused by the "background-attachment" being set to "fixed".

This was changed to "scroll" and a media query for larger screens was written to allow the "fixed" rule and the therefore the parallax effect works on the larger screens.

- ```
  .bg-img {
      background-position: center center;
      background-attachment: scroll;
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-size: cover;
    }
  ```

- `background-attachment: scroll;`
  - must be used on smaller screens for iOS devices.
- `background-attachment: fixed;`

  - is later placed in a CSS media query for larger screens to allow the desired parallax effect. -->
